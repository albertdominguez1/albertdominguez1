# Hi, I'm Albert Dominguez.
</center>

I am a senior at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I study Geography, Geographic Information Systems, and Education. Some of research interests include: demography, urban planning, transportation, and education among minority groups.

Upon graduation, I plan on attending graduate school. My career goal is to become a college counselor. Ideally I would want to work for the college I transferred from, which is Oxnard College. I want to be a role model for the people in my community and I want to help them achieve their academic and career goals.
